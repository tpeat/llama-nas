I have two PyTorch neural network classifiers, both named 'NN'. The first NN model has the following architecture:

{}

The second NN model has this architecture:

{}

I need to create a new PyTorch model, also called 'NN', by integrating elements from these two models. The new model should:

1. Combine features or layers from both the first and second models.
2. Maintain the same input and output sizes as the original models.
3. Be implemented as a class in PyTorch, using nn.Module.
4. Only write code

Could you provide the PyTorch code for this new integrated 'NN' model?
